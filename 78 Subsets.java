Given a set of distinct integers, S, return all possible subsets.

Note:
Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
For example,
If S = [1,2,3], a solution is:

[
  [3],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  []
]




public class Solution {
    
    /*
    Solu 1:
    first, convert from Set to arr[], and sort arr[]
    second, get all subsets
    */
    
    public ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> subsets(int[] S) {
        
    }
}
